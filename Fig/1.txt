This app calculates AC_Mean and AC_Var, which are derived from autocorrelation coefficients of glucose levels measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Autocorrelation functions depend on the lag, which determines how many time points to shift. While we have shown that lag 30 appears to work well for CGM data taken at 5-minute intervals (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. "Improved Detection of Decreased Glucose Handling Capacities via Novel Continuous Glucose Monitoring-Derived Indices: AC_Mean and AC_Var." medRxiv (2023): 2023-09. Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. "Three components of glucose dynamics-value, variability, and autocorrelation-are independently associated with coronary plaque vulnerability." medRxiv (2023): 2023-11.), the optimal lag is unknown when the time interval is different, such as 15-minute intervals. Therefore, this app allows users to change the lag value. This app also calculates the mean (Mean) and the standard deviation (Std) of the glucose levels. This app also performs a multiple regression analysis with Mean, Std, AC_Mean and AC_Var as input variables.
